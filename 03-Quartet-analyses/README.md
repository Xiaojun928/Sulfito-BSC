### NOTE
The number of supported topologies of each quatet was counted using [QuartetScores](https://github.com/lutteropp/QuartetScores)
The original QuatetScores did not output the count of each topology.
By modifying Ln117-120 in /your_installation_path/QuartetScores/src/QuartetCountConverter.hpp, and recompling the QuateteScores, the count of supported topologies for each quartet can be print.

Here, modified QuartetCountConverter.hpp was uploaded.
