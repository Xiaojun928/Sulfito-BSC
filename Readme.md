## Main Scripts

### **01-phylogeny-construction/** - Phylogenetic Tree Construction

This directory contains scripts for building phylogenetic trees from orthologous gene families.

- **S1.orthoFinder_blast.sh**  
  Runs **OrthoFinder** to identify orthologous groups (OGs) from protein sequences using DIAMOND for sequence similarity searches. The script processes `.pep` files (amino acid sequences) from the input directory and generates orthogroup assignments.

- **S2.extract_scp_seq.pl**  
  Extracts single-copy ortholog (SCO) sequences from OrthoFinder results. The script:
  - Reads OrthoFinder output files (`SingleCopyOrthogroups.txt` and `Orthogroups.txt`)
  - Extracts gene sequences for each SCO family in both amino acid (`.faa`) and nucleotide (`.dna`) formats
  - Organizes output into `aa_seq/` and `nuc_seq/` directories

- **S3.cat_aln.pl**  
  Concatenates single-copy ortholog alignments for concatenated phylogenetic analysis.

- **S4.sbatch_iqtree.sh**  
  Submits IQ-TREE jobs for phylogenetic tree construction from concatenated alignments.

- **nuc_seq/** subdirectory scripts:
  - `step1.mafft_aa_aln.pl`: Aligns amino acid sequences using MAFFT
  - `step2.multi2oneline.sh`: Converts multi-line FASTA to single-line format
  - `step3.impose.DNA.on.pep_alignment.pl`: Imposes nucleotide sequences onto protein alignments
  - `step4.trimAl.sh`: Trims alignments using trimAl
  - `step5.batch_iqtree.pl`: Batch runs IQ-TREE for individual gene trees
  - `step6.leaves_reroot.sh`: Reroots trees using different methods (MAD_root, MV_root)
  - `step7.label_generate.pl`: Generates annotation labels for tree visualization

**Input**: `.pep` (amino acid) and `.gene` (nucleotide) sequence files for each genome  
**Output**: Phylogenetic trees for concatenated alignments and individual ortholog families

### **02-RMS-identification/** - Restriction-Modification System Identification

This directory contains scripts for identifying restriction-modification (R-M) systems in genomes.

- **s1_diamond_blastp.sh**  
  Performs DIAMOND BLASTP searches of query genomes against the REBASE R-M enzyme database. The script:
  - Builds a DIAMOND database from REBASE protein sequences
  - Searches each genome's protein sequences (`.faa` files) against the R-M database
  - Uses thresholds: E-value ≤ 1e-5, identity ≥ 30%, query coverage ≥ 50%

- **s2_best_hit_RM.pl**  
  Identifies the best hit R-M enzyme for each query gene. The script:
  - Processes DIAMOND BLASTP output files
  - Selects the best hit (highest scoring) for each locus
  - Annotates hits with R-M enzyme details from REBASE `enzymes.txt`
  - Outputs TSV files (`*_RM.tsv`) with locus, enzyme name, and annotation

- **s3_seek_RM_pairs.pl**  
  Identifies R-M system pairs (restriction enzymes and their cognate modification enzymes) by checking gene neighborhood relationships.

**Note**: After obtaining best hits, R-M systems should be manually verified to ensure that restriction and modification genes are neighbors in the genome.

**Input**: Genome protein sequences (`.faa`), REBASE database  
**Output**: Best hit R-M enzymes for each genome (`*_RM.tsv` files)

### **03-Quartet-analyses/** - Quartet Topology Analysis

This directory contains scripts for analyzing quartet topologies to assess phylogenetic signal and gene tree discordance.

- **s1.QS_uniqgnm.sh**  
  Runs **QuartetScores** to count the number of supported topologies for each quartet of genomes. This script processes gene trees and counts how many trees support each of the three possible quartet topologies.

- **s2.process_quartets.py**  
  Processes QuartetScores output and categorizes quartets based on clade membership:
  - **Same clade**: All four taxa belong to the same clade
  - **Two clade (2-2)**: Two taxa from clade A, two from clade B
  - **Two clade (3-1)**: Three taxa from one clade, one from another
  - **Three clade**: Taxa from three different clades
  - **Two-three clade**: Mixed patterns
  - Standardizes topology representations and generates summary statistics

- **s3.vis_Quartet_prop.R**  
  Visualizes quartet topology proportions using R, generating plots to compare topology distributions across different clade combinations.

**Note**: The original QuartetScores software needs modification to output topology counts. A modified `QuartetCountConverter.hpp` is provided in this directory. Users need to replace the original file in their QuartetScores installation (lines 117-120) and recompile.

**Input**: Gene trees, species tree (`45_gnm_tree.nwk`), clade assignments (`gnm_clade_id.tsv`)  
**Output**: Quartet topology counts and categorized results (`*_results.tsv` files)

### **04-identity-scanning/** - Genomic Identity Analysis

This directory contains scripts for calculating nucleotide identity between genomes and clades.

- **s1.cal_identity.py**  
  Calculates sliding-window nucleotide identity between clade members. The script:
  - Loads core genome alignment and population/clade assignments
  - Uses sliding windows (default: 1000 bp windows, 1000 bp steps)
  - Calculates pairwise identity between genomes from different clades
  - Outputs identity values for each window position

- **s2.vis_identity.py**  
  Visualizes identity scanning results, generating plots showing identity patterns across the genome alignment.

- **s3.check_ANI.py**  
  Calculates Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) between clades. ANI provides a genome-wide measure of sequence similarity and is commonly used for species delineation.

**Input**: Core genome alignment (concatenated), genome-to-clade mapping file  
**Output**: Identity values per window, ANI values between clades (`Sulfito_ANI.txt`)

  Contains scripts for identity calculation and visualization, along with ANI calculation results (`Sulfito_ANI.txt`).

- **05-neutral-simulation/**  
  Reserved for neutral evolution simulation analyses.

## Notes

- Most scripts contain hardcoded paths referring to the original server environment. Users need to modify paths (e.g., `/your/path/of/OrthoFinder/`, `/your/path/of/diamond/`) to match their local installation.

- For **QuartetScores** modification: Replace lines 117-120 in `/your_installation_path/QuartetScores/src/QuartetCountConverter.hpp` with the provided modified version, then recompile QuartetScores.

- **REBASE database** files need to be downloaded separately from the REBASE website and paths updated in the scripts.

- Input file formats:
  - `.pep`: Amino acid sequences in FASTA format
  - `.gene`: Nucleotide sequences in FASTA format
  - `.faa`: Protein sequences (alternative naming)
  - `.dna`: DNA sequences
